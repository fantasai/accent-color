As discussed on [CSSWG Issue 5187](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/5187), and at the [July 1, 2020 CSSWG meeting](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/5187#issuecomment-652700033), there is a desire to expand the stylability of form control elements, in particular by allowing the specification of the “accent color” for various elements. Two action items came out of the CSSWG discussion:



1. Study/enumerate the various places where accent-color might apply, across form elements, platforms, and browsers.
2. Propose spec text for the ‘accent-color’ property.

This document attempts to fulfill both action items.


# Foreground vs. Background

Before enumerating the form controls, an important point needs to be made about foreground vs. background. This was raised in the CSSWG meeting by [florian](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/5187#issuecomment-652700033), and in the exploration below, it does seem like an important distinction. For several form control accent parts, there is a strong case to be made for two accent colors, one for the “background” and one for the “foreground” accent element. For example, a checkbox typically has a foreground “checkmark” glyph and a background color behind the glyph. If only one color (‘accent-color’) is specified, that color might have poor (or no) contrast against the foreground glyph color. Similarly, for the spin buttons on a number input, it might make sense to set the button background color **and** the up/down arrow glyph colors. In other controls, the “accent” element is more of a foreground element itself, and there is no corresponding background. For example, the popup activation widget for a &lt;select> control is typically painted on top of the background color of the text field. For these reasons, the proposal here is to specify two separate properties (subject to bikeshedding the names):



*   ‘accent-color-background’
*   ‘accent-color-foreground’

Given the above, we could also think about a shorthand ‘accent-color’ property that sets the accent-color-background to the specified color, and selects a complementary color (algorithm needed) for ‘accent-color-foreground’. This could also be reversed (set foreground, and auto-select background) but it seems to make the most sense this way. This shorthand property is not included in the proposed spec text in this document.


# Where Might Accent Color Apply?

This section is an exploration of the various controls that might utilize the ‘accent-color’ property. It is not exhaustive, and none of the listed controls and “accent” parts are required by the spec. These are up to each UA to decide. This list was compiled by examining the controls from [this test page](http://concrete-hardboard.glitch.me/) on Chrome (Windows, Mac, Android), Firefox (Windows and Mac), and Safari (Mac and iOS), and examining the various parts of each control. Some of the listed accent parts apply only to some browser/platform combinations, and those are listed in the Notes column.

Particular attention was paid to browsers on Safari, which has a system Accent Color setting. All browsers at least partially utilize this accent color to paint several form control “accent” elements. The elements that change color on Mac are all included in the list below, in addition to many elements that currently do **not** change color in response to Mac Accent Color. What follows is a list of all/common elements that seem (to me) like they **should** respect a ‘accent-color’ setting.

Again, it is important to note that the purpose of this exploration is simply to get a feel for the types of accent parts available, to see what might be controlled by the accent-color properties. These lists could change as browsers change their form control designs.

Setting background color on Firefox causes the activation widgets to go away.

# Existing Control Examples (as of 2020)

This section shows visual samples of several different controls
across various browsers, platforms, and eras (e.g. 2000's).
The intention of presenting these examples
is to provide an easy way for people to evaluate the spec text
and per-controls guidance above in the context of existing controls.

Several variations are also shown for each control,
pulled from the Mac operating system.
One is with Dark Mode enabled,
and the other is with the Accent Color system setting changed to a non-default color.

*Note*: The particular selections of browsers, platforms, eras, and controls
were made in an attempt to show adequate diversity,
while not being an exhaustive list,
and while being as efficient as possible for me to collate.
I have likely left out many important browsers and platforms.
If there is a particular browser/platform/era/control combination
that is not *represented* by a similar element in the lists below
 please bring that to my attention and I can add it.

# Proposed Spec Text

**Name**: ‘accent-color-foreground’ and ‘accent-color-background’

**Value**: &lt;color>

**Initial**: UA-chosen value

**Applies to**: form control elements

**Inherited**: yes

**Percentages**: N/A

**Computed value**: computed color, see resolving color values

**Canonical order**: per grammar

**Animation type**: by computed value type

The ‘accent-color-background’ and ‘accent-color-foreground’ CSS properties set the color of “accent” parts/pieces of form control elements. The **text content** of form control elements are explicitly **not** included in the set of “accent” parts, as text content is already controlled by the [‘color’](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color/#the-color-property) property. Not all form elements contain “accent” parts, and not all user agents use the same “accent” parts in the same way for the same form control. The ‘accent-color-background’ property sets the color of “background” accent elements, while the ‘accent-color-foreground’ property sets the color of “foreground” accent elements. A given control may have only background accents, only foreground accents, both, or neither.

Note: An “accent” part is, by definition, “A feature which gives a distinctive visual emphasis to something.” These accent parts will differ between implementations and potentially across platforms. Examples might include the background color of a checkbox, the activation button/widget for a select control, or the clear (‘X’) button on a search box.

Note: If the operating system provides an “Accent Color” user setting, the UA is encouraged to respect that setting in the initial value for ‘accent-color-background’. The UA may use a similar, though not identical, color in some cases, for example to enhance contrast or accessibility.
